# Regression


In this repository i have used Boston House Dataset for prediction of price of the houuse on the basis of different factors.
I have visualised the data and treat outliers in this dataset.
I have used ensemble techniques in this model creation.
I have also used ANOVA test and RFE recursive feature elimination feature enginering techniques to get better accuracy on the model.
